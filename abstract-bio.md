#### Title: Grades, Assessment, Feedback

Abstract: We will examine the ways that “traditional” grading policies in
college mathematics courses interact with student learning. We will discuss
options for other schemes, including “Specifications Grading” and “Standards
Based Assessment.” You will begin the process of designing a grading scheme
adapted to a particular class of your choice, with a focus on intentional
choices driven by course goals.
